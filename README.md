### Analysis 

One drawback of the webpage is that the filtered search is case sensitive. It doesn't work if any of the words are capitalized. This is counter intuitive for the proper nouns because they are usually capitalized in day-to-day life.


Some recommendations I have is firstly the addition of data for more countries. Right now, it appears that the only country outside of the US is Canada. This leaves the country filter almost useless. I would also recommend more years included in the search. It is a lean pool of data as it stands.
